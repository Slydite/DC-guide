```markdown
If you do not have 25GB of files to upload: You can try and upload random files and folders(As many as you want). ALternatively, **Windows** and **Program Files** in your C: drive will suffice but do note that these carry a privacy concern and Windows might not even let you share them in the first place. If you choose to do this, as soon as you get access to DC++, you have to download 25GB of content from another user and in this [google form](https://forms.gle/NsT7SRp5nSgqpCUX8), list the content and the users you downloaded from. This is so that we can have some redundancy and to allow the other user to host other data instead.

### FAQs

**Where do my files get uploaded?**
They dont! DC++ is peer-to-peer, that means all files are stored on users computers. When you download a file from DC++, the file is moving from the shareing computer to yours. Simmilarly, when you share files, only a list is sent over the network. Anyone downloading your files gets them directly from your drive.

**Is DC++ safe**
Yes. DC++ files are ones shared by your seniors and batchies.
Also, only folders you shared explicitly are acsessable to others.

**What is DC++ used for?**
Any big files! Scice using it doesnt consume any of your 10gb per day limit, you can download huge amounts of movies, show, anime, games, courses, and much more. Share any ones you have on you, or just download and enjoy!

**Is DC++ monitored by BITS**
No! As it is peer-to-peer, BITS has no control over the files shared or downloaded. So go crazy!

**Are there alternatives**
Yes! Notable examples are AirDC++, ApexDC++, and TkDC++
Their interfaces are slightly different, but are all offer the same functionality.

**What about Mac or Linux**
Yes, you can run DC on these platforms.
